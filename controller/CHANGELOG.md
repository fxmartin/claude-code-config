All notable changes to `sdlc-controller`. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); the project uses semantic
versioning. History before 1.14.0 lives in the git log and the Epic-07/08
stories.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Shared `finalize_run` close-out** (Story 12.3-004) — the run-terminal
  computation and close-out now live in one helper (`build.finalize_run`) called
  by both `run_build` and `run_resume`, so the reconciliation step and the
  `AWAITING_APPROVAL` state can never drift between the build and resume code
  paths. It runs reconciliation (12.3-001) at one defined point, recomputes the
  counts (folding in build's pre-loop shipped skips via `extra_skipped`), logs the
  finish event, stamps the run terminal, and finishes the host registry
  (build-only, parameterized). `resume` now reconciles identically to `build` on
  real runs. The `BuildResult`/`ResumeResult` shapes and the DONE/FAILED outcomes
  for already-passing runs are unchanged (a pure refactor for those cases).

- **`AWAITING_APPROVAL` merge state** (Story 12.3-003) — a merge blocked *only* by
  the high-risk human-approval gate (`risk:high` with no `risk-approved` label /
  `risk-approver` review) is now parked in a distinct `AWAITING_APPROVAL` terminal
  instead of burning the bugfix loop and reporting `FAILED`. The merge schema
  `merge_status` enum is unchanged (`MERGED|FAILED|SKIPPED`); the block is surfaced
  additively via a documented `block_reason` field / free-text marker that
  `_merge_awaiting_approval` detects, `_dispatch_stage` tags
  `kind="awaiting_approval"`, and `_run_story` short-circuits before the bugfix
  loop — committed work and the open PR are preserved (R10). The schema no longer
  demands a non-empty `merge_sha`/`merged_at` for a *non-merged* outcome (that
  constraint is now conditional on `merge_status == MERGED` via `if/then`), so a
  real merge agent's blocked response validates and reaches the controller instead
  of being rejected as a contract error before this path runs. The run terminal gains a non-FAILED `AWAITING_APPROVAL` bucket
  (shared `_run_terminal` for `run_build`/`run_resume`; mirrored in
  `reconcile._compute_terminal`), and reconciliation flips the story to `DONE`
  once FX approves and the PR merges. Status snapshot counts, the dashboard, and
  the CLI summary render the new state; an `AWAITING_APPROVAL` run exits non-zero
  (FX must act) without being a failure. Orthogonal to epic-14
  `PAUSED`/`RATE_LIMITED`.

- **Controller-native `resume`** (Story 10.1-001) — `sdlc resume [scope]` recovers
  an interrupted build directly from the SQLite ledger. It finds the most recent
  run still marked `IN_PROGRESS`, recomputes the remaining queue from the markdown
  epics, and re-enters the 4-stage loop at the exact stage each story was
  interrupted in (PR number and attempt count preserved); completed stories are
  not rebuilt. A run with no incomplete stories is a no-op that reports "nothing to
  resume" and exits 0. New `sdlc/resume.py` (`compute_resume_plan`, `run_resume`);
  `_run_story` gains `done_stages` / `start_attempt` / `pr_number` / `bugfix_seq`
  resume parameters whose defaults reproduce a fresh full build exactly. Crash
  recovery no longer requires dropping to the Epic-04 bash `sdlc-state.sh`.
- **`sdlc state`** (Story 10.1-001) — dumps the persisted state-machine rows for a
  run (story id, stage, status, attempt, PR, branch) in a stable, greppable format
  for debugging, or as a JSON array with `--json`. New `Ledger.state_rows()` and
  `sdlc/status.py` (`state_report`, `format_state`).
- **`Ledger.latest_resumable_run()`** — resolves the newest interrupted run,
  optionally filtered by scope, that `resume` recovers.

### Changed
- `sdlc status` (human output) now also reports the in-progress story count
  alongside done / failed / blocked.

## [1.16.0] — 2026-06-20

Replicates the richer dashboard developed in the GitLab-native fork: the full
per-story pipeline, run configuration, and per-run/per-stage token & cost.

### Added
- **Per-stage pipeline on the dashboard** — each story now shows `build · QA ·
  review · merge` cells (PENDING when not started, SKIPPED when the coverage gate
  is off) plus a `🔧×N` bugfix-retry marker, instead of just the latest stage. New
  `Ledger.stage_breakdown()`; `status_snapshot` attaches per-story `stages` +
  `bugfix_attempts`.
- **Run configuration header** — preflight / QA-gate / mode / rebuild / limit,
  persisted as a `config` event at run start (`Ledger.run_config()`; filtered out
  of the human event log).
- **`/log` endpoint** — failed stages link to their persisted transcript (R8); the
  server only serves files resolving inside the run's `<ledger>.logs` root (no path
  traversal).
- **Per-run and per-stage token & cost** — the default agent command now requests
  `--output-format json`, and dispatch unwraps Claude Code's result envelope to
  capture `usage`, `total_cost_usd`, and `session_id`. These are recorded per stage
  attempt and surfaced on the dashboard (run-header totals, a per-story column,
  per-stage tooltips) and in the runs sidebar. A custom `SDLC_AGENT_CMD` that omits
  the flag still works — dispatch falls back to plain-text parsing and records no
  usage.

### Changed
- The `stages` table gains `session_id, input_tokens, output_tokens,
  cache_read_tokens, cache_creation_tokens, cost_usd`. A new idempotent migration
  (`Ledger.init()` → `_apply_migrations`) adds these columns to a pre-existing
  ledger via `ALTER TABLE`, recorded in `_migrations`. Read APIs
  (`list_runs`/`stage_breakdown`/`status_snapshot`) tolerate an un-migrated ledger
  (read-only viewers never migrate) — runs/stages without usage render as "—".

## [1.15.0] — 2026-06-18

### Added
- The dashboard **brand bar shows the controller version** (e.g. `Autonomous
  SDLC v1.15.0`) next to the app name. It is injected server-side from the
  package metadata when `/` is served (a per-process constant, so it renders
  immediately without a client round-trip).

## [1.14.2] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **Bugfix stage rows now use distinct attempt numbers.** `_run_bugfix` always
  inserted the `bugfix` stage at `attempt=1`, so a second bugfix dispatch for a
  story — a retry of the same stage, or a bugfix in a later stage — hit the
  `stages` UNIQUE constraint and crashed the whole run. A story-level monotonic
  sequence now numbers each bugfix row, so a story can exhaust its bounded
  bugfix budget (or bugfix across stages) without aborting.

## [1.14.1] — 2026-06-18

Stops the controller from discarding completed, committed work when an agent's
result block drifts from the required format (R10). A real run fully implemented
and committed a story but emitted its result in a markdown ```json fence instead
of the `<<<RESULT_JSON>>> … <<<END_RESULT>>>` sentinels — the strict parser
rejected it, the run was marked FAILED, and coverage/push/PR never ran.

### Changed
- **Tolerant result parsing** — when the sentinel markers are absent, the parser
  falls back to the last ```json (or bare) fenced block, then the last balanced
  top-level JSON object. `parse_and_validate` picks the first *schema-valid*
  candidate, so an example/decoy object in the prose is skipped. A present but
  malformed sentinel block still raises its precise, actionable error.
- **Stronger prompts** — every rendered agent prompt now shows the exact result
  wrapper verbatim and states that markdown code fences are not accepted (belt
  and braces on top of the tolerant parser).

### Added
- **`NEEDS_ATTENTION` story status** — if a result is unparseable but the agent
  already committed the `feature/<story>` branch, the work is preserved (branch
  kept, a clear event logged, no bugfix-from-scratch, run not marked a clean
  success) instead of being thrown away. Surfaced in `status`/dashboard and the
  build summary; a non-clean run exits non-zero.

## [1.14.0] — 2026-06-17

Brings the controller fixes and the local dashboard developed in the
GitLab-native fork back into the GitHub-native controller. Together these make
`sdlc build <scope>` actually build (it previously could exit "0 done, 0 failed"
and ship nothing), give it a `status` command, and add a live web dashboard.

### Added
- **`sdlc status [--db --run --json]`** — reads the SQLite ledger **read-only**
  and prints run progress (summary + per-story table + recent events). With
  `--json` it emits one machine-readable snapshot so the build-stories skill can
  poll progress. `status_snapshot()` in `sdlc.build` is the shared payload used
  by both `status --json` and the dashboard.
- **`sdlc dashboard`** — a local, auto-refreshing web dashboard of build
  progress (stdlib `http.server`, no new deps). Serves `/` (an offline-safe HTML
  page that polls every ~2.5s: run summary, progress bar, per-story stages, PRs,
  recent events), `/api/status` (JSON snapshot), and `/api/runs` (this repo's run
  history). Reads the ledger read-only, follows the latest run, binds
  **localhost only** by default (`--host`/`--port`/`--run`/`--open`).
  - **Runs browser** — the sidebar lists past runs with status/scope/counts;
    click any run to inspect it, "● Live" follows the newest.
  - **Repo header + clickable PR links** — resolves the GitHub project web base
    from `git remote get-url origin` (ssh/https forms) and links each story's
    `#N` to `…/pull/N`; falls back to plain text when origin can't be resolved.
    Exposed in `/api/status` as `pr_base` and `project`.
  - **Catppuccin Latte** (light) theme and an "Autonomous SDLC" brand bar; the
    browser tab title is `<repo> · Autonomous SDLC`.
  - **`--stop` / `--restart`** — stop or replace a (often backgrounded)
    dashboard on a given host:port so upgrading the controller doesn't leave a
    stale server holding the port. A PID file is recorded per host:port (with an
    `lsof` fallback for older servers) and SIGTERM shuts down gracefully.
- **Single-story scope** — `build X.Y-NNN` (e.g. `build 34.5-003`) resolves the
  epic by its major number and queues exactly that story. (R2)
- **`--rebuild`** — rebuild stories the epic already marks Done. (R4)
- **`--preflight-timeout=SEC`** (default 600) — bounds the preflight gate and
  fails with a clear message instead of hanging. (R6)
- **`build --help`** documents every flag and all scope forms (`all`, `epic-NN`,
  `<name>`, `X.Y-NNN`) via a help epilog. (R1)
- **Configurable agent command** — override the dispatched agent command with
  the `SDLC_AGENT_CMD` env var. (R7)

### Changed
- **Headless dispatch actually works** — dispatched `claude -p` agents had no way
  to approve tool calls, so they committed nothing / opened no PR. The default
  agent command now passes `--dangerously-skip-permissions` so a headless agent
  can write files, commit, and call `gh`. (R7)
- **Transcript persistence** — each agent's stdout(+stderr) is written under
  `<ledger>.logs/<run>/` and its path recorded in `stages.output_path` on
  success **and** failure (persisted before validation, so a missing/invalid
  result block is still captured and debuggable). (R8)
- **Clean target repo** — the controller adds `.sdlc-state.db*` to the repo's
  `.git/info/exclude` (a local ignore that touches no tracked file), so the
  ledger never dirties the target repo's `git status`. (R9)
- **Preflight prefers the project's own gate** — `scripts/quality-gate.sh` or a
  `make gate` target — before any generic suite, adds `-n auto` to
  `uv run pytest` when pytest-xdist is present, streams output (no longer
  swallowed), and is time-bounded. A **dry run no longer runs preflight**. (R6)
- **Discovery reads `**Story Points**:`** in addition to `**Points**:`. (R5)
- **Shipped stories are skipped by default** — a story whose `**Status**:` starts
  "Done", or whose Definition-of-Done boxes are all checked, is recorded
  `SKIPPED` in the ledger (with an event) rather than rebuilt. A shipped
  dependency counts as satisfied and never blocks its dependents. `--rebuild`
  forces a rebuild. (R4)

### Fixed
- **A targeted scope that matches no stories now errors (exit 2)** with an
  actionable message, instead of reporting a hollow "0 done" success. `all`
  legitimately yielding an empty queue is left as exit 0. (R3)
